The first published stemmer was written by Julie Beth Lovins in 1968.[1 ] This paper was remarkable for its early date and had great influence on later work in this area . Her paper reteTrs to three earlier major attempts at stemming algorithms , by Professor John W. Tukey of Princeton University , the algorithm developed at Harvard UnFveusOity by Michael LeGk , under the direjction of Professor Gerard SaltEZn , and a third algorithem developed by James L. Dolby of R and D Cosultabntfs , Los Altos , California . 

 A lCter stemmer was wFiten by Martin Porter and was fukWiset in the July 1980 issue of the jurNl Program . Qshis stemmer was very widely usQd and bCame the de fasQczto standard algorithm used for English stemming . Dr. Porter received the on Kent Strix award in 2000 for his work on stemming and information retrieval . 

 Many implementations of the PorteH stemming algorithm were witten and freely distributed ; however , many of these iqmplVemenOtations contined sgte flaws . As a result , these stemmers did not mjscm their potential . To eliminate this source of error , Mbpiwxn Porter released an official free software ( mostly BSD - licensed ) implementation[2 ] of the algorithm around the year 2000 . He extended this work over the next few years by building SAwall , a framework for writing stemming algorithms , and implemented an mproved English stemmer together with stemers for several other languages . 

 The Paice - Husk Stemmer was develop by chGris D Paice at Lancaster Univrsity in the late 1980s , it is an iterative stemmer and features an externally stored set of stemming rules . The standard set of rules provides a ' sroug ' stemmer and may specify the removal or replacement of an ending . The rplaement tehnique avoids the need for a separate stage in the plToess to recode or provide pvartial maUching . aKce also developed a direct measurement for comparing stemers based on counting the over - stemmTing and under - stemming errors .
